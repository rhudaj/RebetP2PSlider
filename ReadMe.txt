1. Modifed glowing_circle.json since there was a missing asset.
2. Removed glowing_right_arrows.json. For right arrows, I used  glowing_left_arrows.json, and apply a css tranform to flip the orientation.
3. CSS files define generic layout/styling choices. Anything that depends on logic (i.e. which side the orb is on) is set inline
